   architectures and their security implications.

4. Demonstrate understanding of various critical infrastructures and how the integration of
   interacting components introduces security challenges.

5. Demonstrate understanding of security design principles and their application in designing

### Method of Instruction
Instruction will be available in two modes:

* Synchronous online: students will log into Pilot and attend class periods virtually via webex 
  at the assigned meet time.  Webex sessions will be posted in pilot.wright.edu under course content for this course

* Syncronous in person: set meet time in 355 Russ

355 Russ only seats 36 students.  I will poll students to see who intends on attending in person versus online via webex.  
If more students would prefer in person attendance a schedule shall be determined by the instructor of who can attend
each day.
